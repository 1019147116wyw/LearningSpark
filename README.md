# README: The "LearningSpark" project

This project contains snippets of Scala code for illustrating various
Apache Spark concepts. It was Created with IntelliJ Idea 13.1 Community Edition,
JDK 1.7, Scala 10.1 and Spark 1.1.0 on Windows 8. The configuration is
intended to provide those who want to learn Spark with a super easy on-ramp
that doesn't involve Unix, cluster configuration, building from sources or
installing Hadoop. Many of these activities will be necessary later in one's
learning experience, but this project is about Spark programming in Scala.
